# HeadCount 2.0

Feeling like your kids school has been slacking?  Well, what if I told you that instead of having to google schools in colorado, there was an app that could show you the average student scores for each school in Colorado?  Not only can check out your kids school but now you can compare with other schools (cuz we all love to judge eachother).  I introduce to you HeadCount...

* Extracted annual score averages from provided Kindergarden Data. 
* Users can select two districts and compare the annual student score averages of each district from 2004 - 2014.  
* Comparison card is generated showing the aggregate average for each district and a comparison Value.
